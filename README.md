# TODO App

## Objective

A Todo app is a simple application that allows a user to input an action item, as well as a category for organizational purposes. This will be stored as a 'Task'. A Task is defined as an object containing an action item and category.

User input will be stored in a Redux Style Application state, where a user can add, complete, and delete tasks.

## Purpose
Additional experience with TypeScript, Redux, and React as well as desigining mocks.

### Glossary
Adding a Task - User enters a new action item and category to be stored in our application

Completing a Task - User marks a task as complete, and task gets removed from application store.

Deleting a Task - User removes task from application store, marking as obsolete.
